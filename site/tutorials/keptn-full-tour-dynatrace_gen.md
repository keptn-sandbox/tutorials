# Keptn Full Tour on Dynatrace

## Welcome
Duration: 2:00 


In this tutorial you'll get a full tour through Keptn. Before we get started you'll get to know what you will learn while you walk yourself through this tutorial.

### What you'll learn
- How to create a sample project
- How to onboard a first microservice
- How to deploy your first microservice with blue/green deployments
- How to setup quality gates 
- How to prevent bad builds of your microservice to reach production
- How to automatically roll back bad builds of your microservices
- How to integrate other tools like Slack, MS Team, etc in your Keptn integration

You'll find a time estimate until the end of this tutorial in the right top corner of your screen - this should give you guidance how much time is needed for each step.

## Prerequisites
Duration: 5:00

Before you can get started, please make sure to have Keptn installed on your Kubernetes cluster.

If not, please [follow one of these tutorials to install Keptn](../../?cat=installation) on your favourite Kubernetes distribution.


<!-- include other files -->


## Setup Dynatrace
Duration: 7:00

For enabling the Keptn Quality Gates, we are going to use Dynatrace as the data provider. Therefore, we are going to setup Dynatrace in our Kubernetes cluster to have our sample application monitored and we can use the monitoring data for both the basis for evaluating quality gates as well as a trigger to start self-healing.

Positive
: You have to bring your own Dynatrace tenant

If you don't have a Dynatrace tenant yet, sign up for a [free trial](https://www.dynatrace.com/trial/) or a [developer account](https://www.dynatrace.com/developer/).


## Gather Dynatrace tokens
Duration: 6:00

1. Create a Dynatrace API Token

    Log in to your Dynatrace tenant and go to **Settings > Integration > Dynatrace API**. Then, create a new API token with the following permissions:

    - Access problem and event feed, metrics and topology
    - Access logs
    - Configure maintenance windows
    - Read configuration
    - Write configuration
    - Capture request data
    - Real user monitoring JavaScript tag management


    Take a look at this screenshot to double check the right token permissions for you.

    ![Dynatrace API Token](./assets/dt_api_token.png)

1. Create a Dynatrace PaaS Token

    In your Dynatrace tenant, go to **Settings > Integration > Platform as a Service**, and create a new PaaS Token.

1. Store your credentials in a Kubernetes secret by executing the following command. The `DT_TENANT` has to be set according to the appropriate pattern:
  - Dynatrace SaaS tenant (this format is most likely for you): `{your-environment-id}.live.dynatrace.com`
  - Dynatrace-managed tenant: `{your-domain}/e/{your-environment-id}`

    If running on a Unix/Linux based system, you can use variables for ease of use. Naturally, it is also fine to just replace the values in the `kubectl` command itself.

    ```
    DT_TENANT=yourtenant.live.dynatrace.com
    DT_API_TOKEN=yourAPItoken
    DT_PAAS_TOKEN=yourPAAStoken
    ```
    If you used the variables, the next command can be copied and pasted without modifications. If you have not set the variable, please make sure to set the right values in the next command.
    ```
    kubectl -n keptn create secret generic dynatrace --from-literal="DT_TENANT=$DT_TENANT" --from-literal="DT_API_TOKEN=$DT_API_TOKEN"  --from-literal="DT_PAAS_TOKEN=$DT_PAAS_TOKEN"
    ```


## Install Dynatrace integration
Duration: 5:00

1. The Dynatrace integration into Keptn is handled by the *dynatrace-service*. To install the *dynatrace-service*, execute:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-service/0.6.2/deploy/manifests/dynatrace-service/dynatrace-service.yaml
    ```

1. When the service is deployed, use the following command to install Dynatrace on your cluster. If Dynatrace is already deployed, the current deployment of Dynatrace will not be modified.

    ```
    keptn configure monitoring dynatrace
    ```

**Verify Dynatrace configuration**

Since Keptn has configured your Dynatrace tenant, let us take a look what has be done for you:


- *Tagging rules:* When you navigate to **Settings > Tags > Automatically applied tags** in your Dynatrace tenant, you will find following tagging rules:
    - keptn_deployment
    - keptn_project
    - keptn_service
    - keptn_stage
  
    This means that Dynatrace will automatically apply tags to your onboarded services.

- *Problem notification:* A problem notification has been set up to inform Keptn of any problems with your services to allow auto-remediation. You can check the problem notification by navigating to **Settings > Integration > Problem notifications** and you will find a **keptn remediation** problem notification.

- *Alerting profile:* An alerting profile with all problems set to *0 minutes* (immediate) is created. You can review this profile by navigating to **Settings > Alerting > Alerting profiles**.

- *Dashboard and Mangement zone:* When creating a new Keptn project or executing the [keptn configure monitoring](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/reference/cli/#keptn-configure-monitoring) command for a particular project (see Note 1), a dashboard and management zone will be generated reflecting the environment as specified in the shipyard file.


Negative
: If the nodes in your cluster run on *Container-Optimized OS (cos)* (default for GKE), the Dynatrace OneAgent might not work properly, the next steps are necessary. 

Follow the next steps only if your Dynatrace OneAgent does not work properly.

1. To check if the OneAgent does not work properly, the output of `kubectl get pods -n dynatrace` might look as follows:

  ```
  NAME                                           READY   STATUS             RESTARTS   AGE
  dynatrace-oneagent-operator-7f477bf78d-dgwb6   1/1     Running            0          8m21s
  oneagent-b22m4                                 0/1     Error              6          8m15s
  oneagent-k7jn6                                 0/1     CrashLoopBackOff   6          8m15s
  ```

1. This means that after the initial setup you need to edit the OneAgent custom resource in the Dynatrace namespace and add the following entry to the env section:

        env:
        - name: ONEAGENT_ENABLE_VOLUME_STORAGE
          value: "true"

1. To edit the OneAgent custom resource: 

    ```
    kubectl edit oneagent -n dynatrace
    ```


At the end of your installation, please verify that all Dynatrace resources are in a Ready and Running status by executing `kubectl get pods -n dynatrace`:

```
NAME                                           READY   STATUS       RESTARTS   AGE
dynatrace-oneagent-operator-7f477bf78d-dgwb6   1/1     Running      0          8m21s
oneagent-b22m4                                 1/1     Running      0          8m21s
oneagent-k7jn6                                 1/1     Running      0          8m21s
```


## Create your first project
Duration: 5:00

A project in Keptn is the logical unit that can hold multiple (micro)services. Therefore, it is the starting point for each Keptn installation.

To get all files you need for this tutorial, please clone the example repo to your local machine.
```
git clone --branch 0.6.2 https://github.com/keptn/examples.git --single-branch

cd examples/onboarding-carts
```


Create a new project for your services using the `keptn create project` command. In this example, the project is called *sockshop*. Before executing the following command, make sure you are in the `examples/onboarding-carts` folder.

Create a new project with Git upstream:

To configure a Git upstream for this tutorial, the Git user (`--git-user`), an access token (`--git-token`), and the remote URL (`--git-remote-url`) are required. If a requirement is not met, go to [the Keptn documentation](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/manage/project/#select-git-based-upstream) where instructions for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are provided.

```
keptn create project sockshop --shipyard=./shipyard.yaml --git-user=GIT_USER --git-token=GIT_TOKEN --git-remote-url=GIT_REMOTE_URL
```


**Alternatively:** If you don't want to use a Git upstream, you can create a new project without it:
```
keptn create project sockshop --shipyard=./shipyard.yaml
```


For creating the project, the tutorial relies on a `shipyard.yaml` file as shown below:

```
stages:
  - name: "dev"
    deployment_strategy: "direct"
    test_strategy: "functional"
  - name: "staging"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    test_strategy: "performance"
  - name: "production"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    remediation_strategy: "automated"
```


This shipyard contains three stages: dev, staging, and production. This results in the three Kubernetes namespaces: sockshop-dev, sockshop-staging, and sockshop-production.

* **dev** will have a direct (big bang) deployment strategy and functional tests are executed
* **staging** will have a blue/green deployment strategy and performance tests are executed
* **production** will have a blue/green deployment strategy without any further testing. The configured remediation strategy is used for self-healing in production.


Positive
: To learn more about a *shipyard* file, please take a look at the [Shipyard specification](https://github.com/keptn/spec/blob/master/shipyard.md).




## Onboard first microservice
Duration: 5:00

After creating the project, services can be onboarded to our project.

1. Onboard the **carts** service using the [keptn onboard service](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/reference/cli/#keptn-onboard-service) command:

```
keptn onboard service carts --project=sockshop --chart=./carts
```

1. After onboarding the service, tests (i.e., functional- and performance tests) need to be added as basis for quality gates in the different stages:

  * Functional tests for *dev* stage:

    ```
    keptn add-resource --project=sockshop --stage=dev --service=carts --resource=jmeter/basiccheck.jmx --resourceUri=jmeter/basiccheck.jmx
    ```

  * Performance tests for *staging* stage:

    ```
    keptn add-resource --project=sockshop --stage=staging --service=carts --resource=jmeter/load.jmx --resourceUri=jmeter/load.jmx
    ```

    **Note:** You can adapt the tests in `basiccheck.jmx` as well as `load.jmx` for your service. However, you must not rename the files because there is a hardcoded dependency on these file names in the current implementation of Keptn's jmeter-service. 

Since the carts service requires a mongodb database, a second service needs to be onboarded.

* Onboard the **carts-db** service using the [keptn onboard service](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/reference/cli/#keptn-onboard-service) command. The `--deployment-strategy` flag specifies that for this service a *direct* deployment strategy in all stages should be used regardless of the deployment strategy specified in the shipyard. Thus, the database is not blue/green deployed.

```
keptn onboard service carts-db --project=sockshop --chart=./carts-db --deployment-strategy=direct
```

During the onboarding of the services, Keptn creates a namespace for each stage based on the pattern: `projectname-stagename`.

* To verify the new namespaces, execute the following command:

```
kubectl get namespaces
```

```
NAME                  STATUS   AGE
...
sockshop-dev          Active   2m16s
sockshop-production   Active   2m16s
sockshop-staging      Active   2m16s
```

## Deploy first build with Keptn 
Duration: 5:00

After onboarding the services, a built artifact of each service can be deployed.

1. Deploy the carts-db service by executing the [keptn send event new-artifact](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/reference/cli/#keptn-send-event-new-artifact) command:

```
keptn send event new-artifact --project=sockshop --service=carts-db --image=docker.io/mongo --tag=4.2.2
```

1. Deploy the carts service by specifying the built artifact, which is stored on DockerHub and tagged with version 0.11.1:

```
keptn send event new-artifact --project=sockshop --service=carts --image=docker.io/keptnexamples/carts --tag=0.11.1
```

1. Go to Keptn's Bridge and check which events have already been generated. You can access it by a port-forward from your local machine to the Kubernetes cluster:

``` 
kubectl port-forward svc/bridge -n keptn 9000:8080
```

1. The Keptn's Bridge is then available on: http://localhost:9000. 

    It shows all deployments that have been triggered. On the left-hand side, you can see the deployment start events (i.e., so-called `Configuration change` events). During a deployment, Keptn generates events for controlling the deployment process. These events will also show up in Keptn's Bridge. Please note that if events are sent at the same time, their order in the Keptn's Bridge might be arbitrary since they are sorted on the granularity of one second. 

    ![Keptn's Bridge](./assets/bridge.png)

1. **Optional:** Verify the pods that should have been created for services carts and carts-db:

```
kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep carts
```

```
sockshop-dev          carts-77dfdc664b-25b74                            1/1     Running     0          10m
sockshop-dev          carts-db-54d9b6775-lmhf6                          1/1     Running     0          13m
sockshop-production   carts-db-54d9b6775-4hlwn                          2/2     Running     0          12m
sockshop-production   carts-primary-79bcc7c99f-bwdhg                    2/2     Running     0          2m15s
sockshop-staging      carts-db-54d9b6775-rm8rw                          2/2     Running     0          12m
sockshop-staging      carts-primary-79bcc7c99f-mbbgq                    2/2     Running     0          7m24s
```

## View carts service
Duration: 2:00

1. Get the URL for your carts service with the following commands in the respective namespaces:

  ```
  echo http://carts.sockshop-dev.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
  ```

  ```
  echo http://carts.sockshop-staging.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
  ```

  ```
  echo http://carts.sockshop-production.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
  ```

1. Navigate to the URLs to inspect the carts service. In the production namespace, you should receive an output similar to this:

  ![carts in production](./assets/carts-production-1.png)


## Generate traffic
Duration: 2:00

Now that the service is running in all three stages, let us generate some traffic so we have some data we can base the evaluation on.

Change the directory to `examples/load-generation/cartsloadgen`. If you are still in the onboarding-carts directory, use the following command or change it accordingly:

```
cd ../load-generation/cartsloadgen
```

Now let us deploy a pod that will generate some traffic for all three stages of our demo environment.

```
kubectl apply -f deploy/cartsloadgen-base.yaml 
```

The output will look similar to this.
```
namespace/loadgen created
deployment.extensions/cartsloadgen created
```

Optionally, you can verify that the load generator has been started.
```
kubectl get pods -n loadgen

NAME                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
cartsloadgen-5dc47c85cf-kqggb   1/1     Running   0          117s
```





## Setup SLI provider
Duration: 2:00

During the evaluation of a quality gate, the Dynatrace SLI provider is required that is implemented by an internal Keptn service, the dynatrace-sli-service. This service will fetch the values for the SLIs that are referenced in an SLO configuration.

```
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keptn-contrib/dynatrace-sli-service/0.3.1/deploy/service.yaml
```

Configure the already onboarded project with the new SLI provider:

```
keptn configure monitoring dynatrace --project=sockshop
```

Positive
: Since we already installed the Dynatrace service, the SLI provider can fetch the credentials to connect to Dynatrace from the same secret we created earlier.


## Set up the quality gate
Duration: 4:00

Keptn requires a performance specification for the quality gate. This specification is described in a file called `slo.yaml`, which specifies a Service Level Objective (SLO) that should be met by a service. To learn more about the *slo.yaml* file, go to [Specifications for Site Reliability Engineering with Keptn](https://github.com/keptn/spec/blob/0.1.3/sre.md).

Activate the quality gates for the carts service. Therefore, navigate to the `examples/onboarding-carts` folder and upload the `slo-quality-gates.yaml` file using the [add-resource](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/reference/cli/#keptn-add-resource) command:

```
keptn add-resource --project=sockshop --stage=staging --service=carts --resource=slo-quality-gates.yaml --resourceUri=slo.yaml
```

This will add the `SLO.yaml` file to your Keptn - which is the declaritive definition of a quality gate. Let's take a look at the file contents:

```
---
spec_version: "0.1.1"
comparison:
  aggregate_function: "avg"
  compare_with: "single_result"
  include_result_with_score: "pass"
  number_of_comparison_results: 1
filter:
objectives:
  - sli: "response_time_p95"
    key_sli: false
    pass:             # pass if (relative change <= 10% AND absolute value is < 600ms)
      - criteria:
          - "<=+10%"  # relative values require a prefixed sign (plus or minus)
          - "<600"    # absolute values only require a logical operator
    warning:          # if the response time is below 800ms, the result should be a warning
      - criteria:
          - "<=800"
    weight: 1
total_score:
  pass: "90%"
  warning: "75%"
```

## Verify current version
Duration: 3:00

You can take a look at the currently deployed version of our "carts" microservice before we deploy the next build of our microservice.

1. Get the URL for your carts service with the following commands in the respective stages:

```
echo http://carts.sockshop-dev.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
```

```
echo http://carts.sockshop-staging.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
```

```
echo http://carts.sockshop-production.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
```

2. Navigate to `http://carts.sockshop-production.YOUR.DOMAIN` for viewing the carts service in your **production** environment and you should receive an output similar to the following:

![carts service](./assets/carts-production-1.png)


## Deploy a slow build version
Duration: 5:00


1. Use the Keptn CLI to deploy a version of the carts service, which contains an artificial **slowdown of 1 second** in each request.

```
keptn send event new-artifact --project=sockshop --service=carts --image=docker.io/keptnexamples/carts --tag=0.11.2
```

2. Go ahead and verify that the slow build has reached your `dev` and `staging` environments by opening a browser for both environments. Get the URLs with these commands:

```
echo http://carts.sockshop-dev.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
```

```
echo http://carts.sockshop-staging.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
```


![carts service](./assets/carts-dev-2.png)

![carts service](./assets/carts-staging-2.png)


## Quality gate in action
Duration: 7:00 

After triggering the deployment of the carts service in version v0.11.2, the following status is expected:

* **Dev stage:** The new version is deployed in the dev stage and the functional tests passed.
  * To verify, open a browser and navigate to: `http://carts.sockshop-dev.YOUR.DOMAIN`

* **Staging stage:** In this stage, version v0.11.2 will be deployed and the performance test starts to run for about 10 minutes. After the test is completed, Keptn triggers the test evaluation and identifies the slowdown. Consequently, a roll-back to version v0.11.1 in this stage is conducted and the promotion to production is not triggered.
  * To verify, the [Keptn's Bridge](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/reference/keptnsbridge/) shows the deployment of v0.11.2 and then the failed test in staging including the roll-back:

![Quality gate in staging](./assets/quality_gates.png)

* **Production stage:** The slow version is **not promoted** to the production stage because of the active quality gate in place. Thus, still version v0.11.1 is expected to be in production.
  * To verify, navigate to: `http://carts.sockshop-production.YOUR.DOMAIN`


## Verify the quality gate in Keptn's Bridge
Duration: 3:00

Take a look in the Keptn's bridge (that you opened earlier in this tutorial) and navigate to the last deployment. You will find a quality gate evaluation that got a `fail` result when evaluation the SLOs of our carts microservice. Thanks to this quality gate the slow build won't be promoted to production but instead automatically rolled back.

![Keptn's bridge](./assets/quality-gates-bridge.png)



## Deploy a regular carts version
Duration: 3:00

1. Use the Keptn CLI to send a new version of the *carts* artifact, which does **not** contain any slowdown:
  ```
  keptn send event new-artifact --project=sockshop --service=carts --image=docker.io/keptnexamples/carts --tag=0.11.3
  ```

1. To verify the deployment in *production*, open a browser and navigate to `http://carts.sockshop-production.YOUR.DOMAIN`. As a result, you see `Version: v3`.

1. Besides, you can verify the deployments in your Kubernetes cluster using the following commands: 
  ```
  kubectl get deployments -n sockshop-production
  ``` 

  ```
  NAME            DESIRED   CURRENT   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
  carts-db        1         1         1            1           63m
  carts-primary   1         1         1            1           98m
  ```

  ```
  kubectl describe deployment carts-primary -n sockshop-production
  ``` 
  
  ```
  ...
  Pod Template:
    Labels:  app=carts-primary
    Containers:
      carts:
        Image:      docker.io/keptnexamples/carts:0.11.3
  ```




## Self-healing with feature flags
Duration: 2:00

Next, you will learn how to use the capabilities of Keptn to provide self-healing for an application with feature flags based on the [Unleash feature toggle framework](https://unleash.github.io/). 


Positive
: For the sake of this tutorial, we will onboard Unleash as a Keptn project. The carts microservice is already pre-configured for this.

To quickly get an Unleash server up and running with Keptn, follow these instructions:

1. Make sure you are in the correct folder of your examples directory:

    ```
    cd examples/unleash-server
    ```


1. Create a new project using the `keptn create project` command:

    ```
    keptn create project unleash --shipyard=./shipyard.yaml
    ```

1. Onboard unleash and unleash-db using the `keptn onboard service` command:

    ```
    keptn onboard service unleash-db --project=unleash --chart=./unleash-db
    keptn onboard service unleash --project=unleash --chart=./unleash
    ```

1. Send new artifacts for unleash and unleash-db using the `keptn send new-artifact` command:

    ```
    keptn send event new-artifact --project=unleash --service=unleash-db --image=postgres:10.4
    keptn send event new-artifact --project=unleash --service=unleash --image=docker.io/keptnexamples/unleash:1.0.0
    ```

1. Get the URL (`unleash.unleash-dev.KEPTN_DOMAIN`):

    ```
    echo http://unleash.unleash-dev.$(kubectl get cm keptn-domain -n keptn -o=jsonpath='{.data.app_domain}')
    ```

1. Open the URL in your browser and log in using the following credentials:
   * Username: keptn
   * Password: keptn

You should be able to login using the credentials *keptn/keptn*.

## Configure the Unleash server
Duration: 4:00

In this tutorial, we are going to introduce feature toggles for two scenarios:

1. Feature flag for a very simple caching mechanism that can speed up the delivery of the website since it skips the calls to the database but instead replies with static content.

1. Feature flag for a promotional campaign that can be enabled whenever you want to run a promotional campaign on top of your shopping cart.

To set up both feature flags, navigate to your Unleash server and log in. 

1. Click on the red **+** to add a new feature toggle.
  ![unleash-add](./assets/unleash-add.png)

1. Name the feature toggle **EnableItemCache** and add **carts** in the description field.
  ![unleash-cache](./assets/unleash-cache.png)

1. Create another feature toggle by following the same procedure and by naming it the feature toggle **EnablePromotion** and by adding **carts** in the description field.

## Configure Keptn
Duration: 5:00

Now, everything is set up in the Unleash server. For Keptn to be able to connect to the Unleash server, we have to add a secret with the Unleash API URL as well as the Unleash tokens.

1. In order for Keptn to be able to use the Unleash API, we need to add the credentials as a secret to our Keptn namespace. In this tutorial, we do not have to change the values for UNLEASH_SERVER, UNLEASH_USER, and UNLEASH_TOKEN, but in your own custom scenario this might be needed to change it to your actual Unleash URL, user and token. 
As said, in this tutorial we can use the following command as it is:

    ```
    kubectl -n keptn create secret generic unleash --from-literal="UNLEASH_SERVER_URL=http://unleash.unleash-dev/api" --from-literal="UNLEASH_USER=keptn" --from-literal="UNLEASH_TOKEN=keptn"
    ```

1. Keptn has to be aware of the new secret to connect to the Unleash server and to set the feature toggles. Therefore, the *remediation-service* must be restarted:

    ```
    kubectl delete pod -l=run=remediation-service -n keptn
    ```

1. Finally, switch to the carts example (`cd examples/onboarding-carts`) and add the following remediation instructions

        remediations:
        - name: "Response time degradation"
          actions:
          - action: featuretoggle
            value: EnableItemCache:on
        - name: "Failure rate increase"
          actions:
          - action: featuretoggle
            value: EnablePromotion:off

    using the command:

    ```
    keptn add-resource --project=sockshop --service=carts --stage=production --resource=remediation_feature_toggle.yaml --resourceUri=remediation.yaml
    ```

    **Note:** The file describes remediation actions (e.g., `featuretoggle`) in response to problems/alerts (e.g., `Response time degradation`) that are sent to Keptn.

Now that everything is set up, next we are going to hit the application with some load and toggle the feature flags.

## Run the experiment
Duration: 5:00

1. In this tutorial, we are going to turn on the promotional campaign, which purpose is to add promotional gifts to about 30&nbsp;% of the user interactions that put items in their shopping cart. 

1. Click on the toggle next to **EnablePromotion** to enable this feature flag.

    ![enable-toggle](./assets/unleash-promotion-toggle-on.png)

1. By enabling this feature flag, a not implemented function is called resulting in a *NotImplementedFunction* error in the source code and a failed response. After a couple of minutes, the monitoring tool will detect an increase in the failure rate and will send out a problem notification to Keptn.

1. Keptn will receive the problem notification/alert and look for a remediation action that matches this problem. Since we have added the `remediation.yaml` before, Keptn will find a remediation action and will trigger the corresponding action that will disable the feature flag.

1. Finally, take a look into the Keptn's Bridge to see that an open problem has been resolved:

## Finish
Duration: 1:00

Thanks for taking a full tour through Keptn!
Although Keptn has even more to offer that should have given you a good overview what you can do with Keptn.

### What we've covered


- We have created a sample project with the Keptn CLI and set up a multi-stage delivery pipeline with the `shipyard` file
  ```
  stages:
    - name: "dev"
      deployment_strategy: "direct"
      test_strategy: "functional"
    - name: "staging"
      deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
      test_strategy: "performance"
    - name: "production"
      deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
      remediation_strategy: "automated"
  ```

- We have set up quality gates based on service level objectives in our `slo` file
  ```
  ---
  spec_version: "0.1.1"
  comparison:
    aggregate_function: "avg"
    compare_with: "single_result"
    include_result_with_score: "pass"
    number_of_comparison_results: 1
  filter:
  objectives:
    - sli: "response_time_p95"
      key_sli: false
      pass:             # pass if (relative change <= 10% AND absolute value is < 600ms)
        - criteria:
            - "<=+10%"  # relative values require a prefixed sign (plus or minus)
            - "<600"    # absolute values only require a logical operator
      warning:          # if the response time is below 800ms, the result should be a warning
        - criteria:
            - "<=800"
      weight: 1
  total_score:
    pass: "90%"
    warning: "75%"
  ```

- We have tested our quality gates by deploying a bad build to our cluster and verified that Keptn quality gates stopped them.

- We have set up self-healing by automated toggling of feature flags in Unleash
  ![unleash](./assets/unleash-promotion-toggle.png)


## Getting started with Keptn integrations
Duration: 3:00

Keptn can be easily extended with external tools such as notification tools, other [SLI providers](link to docs), bots to interact with Keptn, etc.
While we do not cover additional integrations in this tutorial, please feel fee to take a look at our integration repositories:

- [Keptn Contrib](https://github.com/keptn-contrib) lists mature Keptn integrations that you can use for your Keptn installation
- [Keptn Sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox) collects mostly new integrations and those that are currently under development - however, you can also find useful integrations here.
