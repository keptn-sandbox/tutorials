# Progressive Delivery with Keptn using Dynatrace

## Welcome
Duration: 2:00 

In this tutorial you'll get a full tour of setting up Keptn for multi-stage progressive delivery for a node-js based microservice application.
The tutorial also gives you insights into load test automation and extending SLIs/SLOs with Load Test specific metrics gathered through Dynatrace Calculated Metrics!
Alright - here is the complete overview on what you will learn:

You can also watch a recording of an online workshop titled [Setting up Event-based Progressive Delivery with Keptn on k8s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZuTr_enelM0)


### What you'll learn
- How to create a Keptn project for multi-stage delivery
- How to onboard a container based microservice
- How to deploy your first version of the microservice with blue/green deployments
- How to setup a basic SLI/SLO-based quality gate between staging and production 
- How to define automated performance tests as part of the quality gate
- How to prevent bad builds of your microservice to reach production
- How to extend SLIs & SLOs with advanced Dynatrace metrics
- How to create a Dynatrace Performance Insights Dashboard
- How to integrate other tools like Slack, MS Team, etc in your Keptn integration

You'll find a time estimate until the end of this tutorial in the right top corner of your screen - this should give you guidance how much time is needed for each step.

## Prerequisites
Duration: 5:00

Before you can get started, please make sure to have Keptn installed on your Kubernetes cluster.

If not, please [follow one of these tutorials to install Keptn](../../?cat=installation) on your favourite Kubernetes distribution.

What you need in order to complete this tutorial is
1: keptn status needs to successfully connect to your keptn instance
