## Create your first project
Duration: 5:00

A project in Keptn is the logical unit that can hold multiple (micro)services. Therefore, it is the starting point for each Keptn installation.

To get all files you need for this tutorial, please clone the example repo to your local machine.
```
git clone --branch 0.6.2 https://github.com/keptn/examples.git --single-branch

cd examples/onboarding-carts
```


Create a new project for your services using the `keptn create project` command. In this example, the project is called *sockshop*. Before executing the following command, make sure you are in the `examples/onboarding-carts` folder.

Create a new project with Git upstream:

To configure a Git upstream for this tutorial, the Git user (`--git-user`), an access token (`--git-token`), and the remote URL (`--git-remote-url`) are required. If a requirement is not met, go to [the Keptn documentation](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.6.0/manage/project/#select-git-based-upstream) where instructions for GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket are provided.

```
keptn create project sockshop --shipyard=./shipyard.yaml --git-user=GIT_USER --git-token=GIT_TOKEN --git-remote-url=GIT_REMOTE_URL
```


**Alternatively:** If you don't want to use a Git upstream, you can create a new project without it:
```
keptn create project sockshop --shipyard=./shipyard.yaml
```


For creating the project, the tutorial relies on a `shipyard.yaml` file as shown below:

```
stages:
  - name: "dev"
    deployment_strategy: "direct"
    test_strategy: "functional"
  - name: "staging"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    test_strategy: "performance"
  - name: "production"
    deployment_strategy: "blue_green_service"
    remediation_strategy: "automated"
```


This shipyard contains three stages: dev, staging, and production. This results in the three Kubernetes namespaces: sockshop-dev, sockshop-staging, and sockshop-production.

* **dev** will have a direct (big bang) deployment strategy and functional tests are executed
* **staging** will have a blue/green deployment strategy and performance tests are executed
* **production** will have a blue/green deployment strategy without any further testing. The configured remediation strategy is used for self-healing in production.
