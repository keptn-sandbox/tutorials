## Open Keptn's bridge
Duration: 1:00

Now that you have installed Keptn you can take a look at its user interface aka the Keptn's Bridge.

Expose the bridge via the following command to be able to access on localhost:

```
kubectl port-forward svc/bridge -n keptn 9000:8080
```

Open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:9000 to take look. The bridge will be empty at this point but when using Keptn it will be populated with events.
