## Bring your own Kubernetes cluster

Keptn can be installed on a variety of Kubernetes distributions. Please find a full compatibility matrix for supported Kubernetes versions [here](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.11.x/operate/k8s_support/).

Positive
:  For the sizing of the Kubernetes cluster we recommend a cluster with at least 8vCPUs and 30 GB of memory.
Detailed sizing recommendations for different platforms can be found in the respective [setup tutorials](../../?cat=installation). 

Please find tutorials [how to set up your cluster here](../../?cat=installation). For the best tutorial experience, please follow the sizing recommendations given in the tutorials.

Positive
: Please note that if you are following one of the installation tutorials, only steps ①-③ are needed (setup of cluster) since we are going to install Keptn as part of this tutorial.

Please make sure your environment matches these prerequisites:

- kubectl
- Linux or MacOS (preferred as some instructions are targeted for these platforms)
- On Windows: [Git Bash 4 Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/), [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)
