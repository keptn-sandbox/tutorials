## Getting started with Keptn integrations
Duration: 3:00

Keptn can be easily extended with external tools such as notification tools, other [SLI providers](https://keptn.sh/docs/0.11.x/quality_gates/sli/), bots to interact with Keptn, etc.
While we do not cover additional integrations in this tutorial, please feel fee to take a look at our integration repositories:

- [Keptn Contrib](https://github.com/keptn-contrib) lists mature Keptn integrations that you can use for your Keptn installation
- [Keptn Sandbox](https://github.com/keptn-sandbox) collects mostly new integrations and those that are currently under development - however, you can also find useful integrations here.
