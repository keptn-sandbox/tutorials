## Validate deployment of first version 
Duration: 2:00

After every deployment we can start in the Keptn's bridge to validate the progress. We can answer questions like
* Did the deployment already happen?
* What is the URL of the deployed service in each stage?
* Did anything bad happen?

1. Go to Keptn's Bridge and see how Keptn has deployed the service into staging and then production:

The bridge also gives you access to the links of the deployed service.

If you click on them you should see a new browser window pop open showing you version 1 in staging and version 1 in production:
